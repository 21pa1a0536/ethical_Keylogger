Ethical Keylogger in Python

This project is a simple ethical keylogger built using the pynput library in Python. It listens for keystrokes and logs them into a file (log.txt).
The program captures regular key presses, spaces, and enter keys while handling backspace operations to maintain accuracy.
The logged data is stored efficiently, with each line representing a complete user input.

Key Features:
Captures keystrokes in real-time.

Handles special keys like space, enter, and backspace.

Stores logs in a text file for analysis.

Stops logging when the Esc key is pressed.

This project serves as a learning tool for understanding keyboard event handling and cybersecurity concepts in Python.
